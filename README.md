# Apex Legends Autoexec

This is an in-depth autoexec for Apex Legends, it is a combination of my personnal and other autoexecs I found online such as Couleur's. You'll find a bunch of optimizations that will make your game look relatively bad but give you an incredibly smooth experience with a constant 300 fps in most scenarios as well as very good visibility.

## ðŸ“– Installation

* Download `autoexec.cfg` and paste it in `..\Apex Legends\cfg\`
* Launch Steam, right click on Apex Legends, and click on `Properties`
* Inside the `Launch Options` type the following `+exec autoexec.cfg`
